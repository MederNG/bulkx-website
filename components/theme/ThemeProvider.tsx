   * The obvious way to do this is a transition on the colours themselves,

   * on the page interpolating a colour at once took the switch from ~90fps
   * down to about 20, which is worse to look at than the snap it replaced.
   * Fading one full-screen layer instead is a single composited animation —
   * measured free — and the eye reads it the same way, because what it is
   * actually following is the change in overall brightness.
