 * of the arc until the horizon cuts it off, while the other climbs the
 * opposite side. The sun keeps the right-hand side and the moon the left, in
 * both directions — each rises where it last set.
 *
 * The turn is CSS keyed off `data-theme`, not React state. The blocking
 * script in <head> puts that attribute on <html> before the first paint, so
 * a light-theme visitor's sun is already up when the page appears. Driven
 * from state it could not be: the server has no way to know the theme, so
 * every load would paint the dark sky first and then spin it.
