 * The dashboard figures are precomputed in CI rather than at request time.
 *
 * Computing them costs ~450ms of CPU: reading and parsing the 34MB
 * leaderboard, then twenty passes and eight sorts over 56k entries. Its
 * inputs move once a week (the aura refresh) and once a day (totals), so
 * doing that work in the request path meant paying it thousands of times per
 * actual change — and it was the bulk of the project's Fluid Active CPU.
 *
 * The cron writes this file next to the data it derives from, so the running
 * app only reads a small JSON and never touches the 34MB source.
